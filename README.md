# XSS Labs - Notes

Tracking my progress learning **Web Application Security**  
and completing **PortSwigger XSS Academy**.

| Lab | Type | Status | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|------|
| Reflected XSS 01 | Basic injection | ✔ Completed | `<script>alert(1)</script>` works |
| Reflected XSS 02 | HTML context | ❌ Pending | Will try payload variations |

## Tools & Skills Practicing
- Burp Suite
- Manual payload crafting
- Input validation bypass
- DOM testing (coming soon)
